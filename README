♠️ BLACKJACK ♥️

A classic casino blackjack game where you play against the dealer trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

About the Game

I built this blackjack game because I've always enjoyed the strategy and excitement of casino card games. Blackjack is simple enough to learn but has enough depth to stay interesting. This project gave me a chance to practice JavaScript game logic and DOM manipulation while creating something fun to play.
